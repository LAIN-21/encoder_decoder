# Encryptor & Decryptor

Welcome to your own encryptor-decryptor. This was a project from the codecademy Full-Stack engineer path that I took into my own hands as I found it really interesting. 

## Instructions

This program uses 3 types of encryption algorithms, namely: Caesar Cipher, Reverse Cipher, and Symbol Cipher.

### Individual Ciphers

The different encryptors can be used indiviudally by calling  "node message_mixer.js ciphername."

You will then be prompted for the message to code using that cipher algorithm.

### Super Encoder

However, the most interesting part of this program is the super-encoder that uses all of these encryptors in one, creating the most encrypted message possible.

To use it, call "node super_encoder.js encode" or "node super_encoder.js decode"

You will be prompted to enter your code to decode or encode. 

## Note

Remember to have node installed in your computer.
